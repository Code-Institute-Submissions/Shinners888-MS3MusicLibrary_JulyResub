MUSO - The Misanthropic Unicorns Symphony Orchestra presents "Bringing Classic Back"

A community built collection of favourites in the various classical/art music genres, to reignite a love of the music.

Features include:
- The ability to browse favourites uploaded by other users
- The ability to upload information about your own favourite pieces
- A way to inform the admin that there are duplicates/incorrect information
- Admin can update/delete on a case by case basis
- The ability to search by composer, genre, piece etc...
- Discounts to performances by the symphony orchestra for registered users

## Goals

To build a community of people who like classical music and recommend music to those who are new to the genre and may find it overwhelming. The symphony orchestra will let the most popular pieces on the website dictate what is performed every few months and discounts will be available to members of the community for those concerts.
